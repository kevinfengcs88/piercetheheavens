        </h3>
        <hr class="line"> 
        <p>
            In the summer of 2016, exactly four years prior to the creation of this website, 
            I created my first website, <u>www.piercetheheavensproject.com</u> (which is no longer being hosted) as a means
            of archiving the ideas of myself and others in order to take a philosophical lens to the complex world that we live in. 
            Now that I think back on it, I never set out to do that&mdash;the website started out as a research project 
            on the concerningly slow progress of national space organizations on propulsion. It quickly took on
            more and more inquiries aside from the stagnation of propulsion, including the human pineal gland (the third eye),
            living architecture, and the artificial intelligence. I was largely fascinated with the concept of impossibility,
            and much of my inspiration sprouted from my deep interest in impossible figures&mdash;those 2D illusions that make your
            mind question the feasibility of their existence in a 3D plane. You can learn more about impossible figures in this blog post
            <a href="#">here.</a> 
        </p>
        <p>
            <u>piercetheheavens.ga</u> is a continuation of the project that I started that one summer's day. I will continue
            my research into the advancement of artificial intelligence, the sustainability of the Earth, the colonization of Mars, 
            archetypes in literature, and most notably, humanity. I've always found myself with an innate love for humans, as odd
            as that may sound in writing. Growing up in a world filled with more and more individuals holding strong
            dissatisfaction for humans and even their own countries has made me realize the unique circumstances we find ourselves in
            today. Though we are already one-fifth of the way through this century, we're still very much in the turn of the 21<sup>st</sup>
            century. Unimaginable advances in technology will come forth in the upcoming years, and as human innovation has 
            demonstrated time and time again, they will be impossible in the modern perspective. It's almost certain that thousands
            of these inventions are already here, but are simply veiled from the public. Unveiling those innovations prematurely
            while hearkening to the patterns of humanity's past is to pierce the heavens.

            I'd like to think that I really didn't know who I was until 8th grade, right before entering high school. 
            It began in 1st period Geometry with Dr. Steffero&mdash;a class that was unlike the usual flood of busy work and 
            meaningless memorization. Like a few select classes throughout my early education, I felt that I could learn with the system
            without even realizing it. I found this freedom in particular with one project that had very few limitations apart
            from the topics provided (of which there were a wide variety). I was glad to see that "impossible figures" was an
            available topic. I had always been fascinated by the illusions, borrowing <u>The Great Book of Optical Illusions</u>
            from the public library over and over again (often in consecutive instances). It's difficult to put a finger on 
            exactly which part of these optical illusions intrigued me, but it was certain that I became engrossed in the concept
            of the <b>impossible</b> itself.

        <p>
            Just taking a look at impossible figures such as the Penrose Triangle above, I began to wonder about what deemed these
            entities as impossible. Why was anything impossible in the first place? If something were to be impossible, then it would
            be, in the most literal sense, not possible, or unachievable, across any number of trials, right? These types of questions
            led me down a rabbit hole of metaphysical exploration, of which I was unaware at the time. You can read more about my
            exploration of the impossible in the same article mentioned above.
        </p>
        <p>
            Impossible figures. That's where it all started. Looking at something that had a both abstract and tangible existence
            in the world at a level far deeper than I ever would have imagined has inspired me in everything else. Impossible figures
            have brought me both reason and emotion, sanity and lunacy, and order and chaos. My name is Kevin Feng, and this is my story.
