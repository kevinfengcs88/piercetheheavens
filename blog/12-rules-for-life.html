            12 RULES FOR LIFE: REVISITED
        </h3>

            By: Kevin Feng
        </h4>
        <p>
            In 2018, I stumbled across a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx4ltQhdlhg">podcast</a> 
            that ended up changing my life. I could take it even further back and say two years prior, I had stumbled
            across a YouTube comedy/commentary channel that ended up changing my life. "h3h3productions" joined YouTube on
            April 29th, 2011&mdash;right around the time as other big YouTubers were on the rise, such as the famous Swedish videogame
            aficionado, Pewdiepie (who hit one million subscribers in the following year), and as millions of people around the world
            discovered the revolution that is YouTube. h3h3productions began with
            Ethan and Hila Klein, a couple that made humurous edits and offered satirical commentary for various points of interest
            in internet culture. Their channel rapidly expanded, reaching one million subscribers by March of 2016, and holding well over
            1 billion views on just their main channel. Ethan and Hila also created a podcast, appropriately named the H3 Podcast in 2016,
            and have since created over 200 episodes with their dedicated and hard-working staff. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I had first delved into the universe of h3h3 with the main channel's comedy videos, relating strongly to the
            commentary and reactions given towards the various internet content including, but not limited to: radical feminists,
            YouTube pranksters, The Learning Channel, and anything that's "cringeworthy" of an Ethan cough. Although these videos
            were very entertaining, they weren't incredibly meaningful, or content that would spur deep thinking on my part. I 
            watched these videos just to have a laugh, nothing more. 
        </p>
        <p>
            So when I started looking into a few of the episodes of the H3 Podcast, I was gladly surprised to find several friends
            of the channel engaging in meaningful and genuine conversation with Ethan and Hila. But as per usual, I stuck around
            with what I was familiar with; I listened in to the episode featuring Michael Stevens, from Vsauce, as well as the one
            with Ian, or more commonly known as iDubbbz. I relistened to episodes featuring guests that I already knew to the point
            that I was listening just to listen to something&mdash;just to have audio being sent to my ears while I busied myself with
            studying, work, etc.
        </p>
        <p>
            I can't recall what made me decide to click on an episode featuring a guest that I had no familiarity with, or if there
            was anything special about that day (in retrospect, these kinds of things never have anything unique going on during the day)
            , but I listened to the entire podcast featuring Dr. Jordan Peterson, a professor at the University of Toronto with degrees
            in political science, psychology, and a PhD in clinical psychology. He's written two books, one being <i>12 Rules for Life:
            An Antidoe to Chaos</i> (which is the main focus of this column and those following it), and the other being <i>Maps of Meaning:
            The Architecture of Belief</i>, which I have yet to read.

        <p>
            Jordan Peterson has served as a huge inspiration to me, and it all started with that one podcast from a YouTube
            comedy channel. The two H3 Podcasts that Dr. Peterson has been featured on can be found 
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx4ltQhdlhg&t=280s">here(#1)</a> and 
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFANYt52m1g">here(#2)</a>.
            I've listened to these dozens of times by now, and I still feel like I can learn something new from the intellectually
            deep conversations within them. Whether it's discussion regarding the connection between the metaphysical and tangible
            worlds or how "truth" is perceived differently in fiction and nonfiction, Jordan makes his listeners, his readers,
            and anyone who has experienced his work in some way, pay attention to his stories that are universally applicable
            to the domain of life. 
        </p>
        <p>
            12 Rules For Life is the type of book that you can read over and over again, and feel like you didn't
            retain everything it had to say, yet feel deeply connected to the meaningful messages in it (even having forgotten some
            of the rules). That's why repetition is so important (rereading a book in this case), and Peterson discusses that both
            in the book and in many of his talks/lectures. The fundamental structure, chronologically speaking, of one's life,
            is through repetition&mdash;and that's the repetition of days. This self-truth manifests itself particularly distinctly when
            you (as Jordan says it) "do the arithmetic."
        </p>
        <p>
            I read Dr. Peterson's book just over a year ago, and found it to be a incredibly complex, but most importantly,
            paramountly relevant in today's society. With a young generation completely lost in a realm of moral relativism
            that's being fed nothing but rights and unexplained moral high grounds, accepting ideologically blindness
            and possession, and becoming the prime target for mindless political indoctrination, these 12 concrete rules are 
            needed now more than ever before. 
        </p>
        <p>
            As discussed in the foreword, which is written by psychoanalyst, psychiatrist, and author, Dr. Norman Doidge,
            moral relativism is nothing new. The idea that there is no absolute right or wrong has strongly been reinforced
            throughout the course of history as different cultures met with each others and discovered entirely contrasting
            value systems. The idea of moral relativism isn't particularly dangerous; rather it's the way that individuals and
            society respond to it. The ancient Greeks, widely regarded as the first philosophers (in fact, the word philosophy
            is derived from the Greek roots of "philo-," meaning "love," and "-sophy," meaning wisdom) came across moral relativism
            as they sailed to different parts of the world, surprised to find different cultures, and therefore, different values. 
            But the Greeks did not respond to their discovery in the manner that our postmodernist society has in the recent decades.
            Upon discovery of the mere potential of moral relativism, the Greeks became philosophers, and that's no small accomplishment
            considering that they were truly the first philosophers. Socrates took it upon himself to ask questions like
            "What is justice?" and "How does one live the good life?" (a classic philosophical question that then delves in the core
            and fundamental question: "What is the meaning of life?") and sought answers to what was seemingly impossible to answer.
            These abstract questions from philosophers like Socrates and Aristotle that forced the human brain to gaze in upon 
            itself brought forth philosophy, and we define wisdom somewhat as a degree of capacity, or a certain competence
            to provide answers to those deep questions. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Unfortunately for today's society, the young generation is bereft of wisdom, hold less respect for elders (but more importantly,
            the stories that they have to offer that hold their own truths), and is taught to react to differences in culture
            with tolerance. Which isn't to say tolerance is an immoral or impractical approach to varying value systems; it's just
            that tolerance has been preached so heavily that young people are no longer focused on individuality&mdash;they're focused on
            groups. Young people no longer recognize the significance of personal responsibility and how that it completely and utterly
            tangled with the meaning of life&mdash;they're willing to subsist off of rights and those who purportedly are being denied
            such rights (while living in the freest nation on the planet). 
        </p>
        <p>
            As a member of Generation Z, I've found myself exposed to this environment that places tolerance as an utmost importance
            at a very young age. Starting in elementary school, the emphasis placed on tolerating others was made very clear through
            the lessons that teachers gave, or the various assemblies that were held. Looking back on it, "tolerance" is an entirely
            different creature than "kind" or "benevolent." But as an 8-year-old being instructed on how to tolerate others to the point
            that questions&mdash;the pursuit of truth and the pursuit of answers&mdash;weren't being asked, I had no idea that there was any
            difference. But upon the realization that necessary inquiries arise from blind tolerance, the significance of responsibility
            comes forth; it comes forth as self-evident, self-emanating, and undeniably fundamental to life. But in the face of
            responsibilty and therefore, insurmountable work, what can be done? What can be done in the chaos that is the complex world
            of suffering that we live in?
        </p>
        <p>
            Perhaps 12 Rules for Life is a good start. Although I've read it once, I'm taking this journey once more.
            I'm certain there is more to learn, and I'm certain that my interpretations of the rules will be different. 
            So how do I interpret rules before giving the book another read?
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>1. Stand up straight with your shoulders back:</b><br>
            "Fake it 'till you make it;" the confidence derived from false confidence is a helpful, not harmful,
            positive feedback loop. In public speaking for example, maintaining proper posture, making eye contact, and projecting
            your voice all demonstrate confidence in your speech. The feedback from the audience actively tells you what is being 
            done right, which you can continue to do, and what is being done wrong, which you should prioritize fixing. But without
            that confidence to start with (whether it is false or not), there is no first step to tell you if you are heading in 
            the right direction. Inspiration does not strike like lightning, your own effort will ultimately give you inspiration
            that comes in the form of feedback (insert lobster meme).
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>2. Treat yourself like someone you are responsible for helping:</b><br>
            People don't take their own medicine. People don't exercise knowing full well it's good for them. But once
            tasked with taking care of another person, people will meticulously plan out their day to ensure that their
            responsibility (in the form of another person) is taken care of. By viewing yourself not as "yourself" but
            an entirely different person, you facilitate your own growth by taking on the natural responsibilty of caring
            for another human being.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>3. Make friends with people who want the best for you:</b><br>
            It's common to hear that you slowly become like those that you surround yourself with. Especially in the case of
            ideological possession, you and your group of "friends" race to the bottom by alienating those that step out of line.
            True friends are those that want you to succeed and desire to see you reach your goals. Instead of bragging about his/her
            accomplishments after you discuss your promotion at work, they praise you and rationalize how your hard work and decision to 
            take on task X led you to get promotion Y. Genuine friends are irreplaceable means of facilitating growth and the reciprocity
            of friendship allows everyone to become better.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>4. Compare yourself to who you were yesterday, not to who someone else is today:</b><br>
            Many cases of unhealthily low self-esteem comes from looking at others and their accomplishments rather than those of
            your accomplishments in the past. Though competition with others is healthy to a certain degree, most motivation comes
            from self-improvement. The betterment of oneself is incentive enough to take on more responsibility and aim high; doing
            good for oneself, his/her family, and society compared to what was done the previous day is an enormous boon in 
            the journey of life.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>5. Do not let your children do anything that makes you dislike them:</b><br>
            Your children (mostly when they are still at the age of being "children") have little experience and little wisdom.
            To help them grow, a parent's job is to expose them to as many things as possible. There will challenges along the way,
            new tasks that spur the literal production of new proteins in their rapidly-developing brains, but when they do things
            that conflict with their growth and demonstrate unhealthy stagnation, it is not your job as a parent to tolerate it.
            The repercussions of allowing children to have more power in the relationship with their parent as the adult refuses
            the responsibility of constructive punishment/criticism leads to weak people: former children that have a false sense
            of power and adults that bear no responsibility for their failures. 
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>6. Set your house in perfect order before you criticize the world:</b><br>
            You have to work your way up in the world&mdash;there is a simple hierarchy of what you are allowed to interact with
            successfully. Your surroundings are the physical embodiment of the world, and at the lowest level, you have your room. Then 
            you have your house, and then your community, and eventually you can start criticzing society and the world itself. But
            taking on the assumption that you can have genuine complaints about the justice system or a certain view that a majority 
            of the "world" holds before your home or even your room is in order is a dangerous path to go down. It's another sense
            of false power and fake reponsibility&mdash;to look at rights, those flaws of society, rather than your individual
            responsibility.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>7. Pursue what is meaningful (not what is expedient):</b><br>
            This is hands down my favorite rule. Out of all the rules, it has the most direct connection to the question of
            "What is the meaning of life?" The rule itself poses the question of "What is meaningful?" and to answer that, I can still
            recall an incredible analogy that Dr. Peterson made to explain the meaning of life. To simplify what is life, and to 
            simplify what is the meaning of life, we define them as "suffering" and "responsibility," respectively. For life is
            suffering, and that is the first tenet of any major religion. The chance of you having heavy, metaphorical baggage, such
            as a mental disease, a physical disability, trauma, etc. is high, and if it's not you, it's someone you love. That baggage
            becomes even heavier with you because as mentioned in Rule #2, you take better care of those you are responsible for&mdash;those
            you love. If it isn't true that you or someone you love has this type of baggage now, it's nearly certain that it will be
            true within the next ten years. The source of this pain can even come from young children or babies, and the significance in
            that is the suffering that they endure draws such a stark contrast with their innocence (we really do hold a newborn as
            the paragon of innocence). Although I'm not a parent, I can imagine that the worst feeling is to see your child, sick,
            suffering unbearably, for they have never experienced such pain before, and all you can do is sit there and comfort them. 
            So how do we confront this suffering&mdash;this miserable existence that we know to be life? Well, we confront it head-on,
            and voluntarily, at that. It's no small task to confront the idea of life, which is fundamentally, suffering, both voluntarily,
            and without any hesitance. Yet we do so, nonetheless, and only because we can wield the weapon that is called "responsibility"
            against the monster that is "suffering." But responsibility is a tricky thing, even if we declare it simply as the meaning
            of life. The analogy that Dr. Peterson gives to explain the meaning of life, and therefore, the "way that is proper" is
            similar to what follows. There is an old Taoist symbol, which we call yin and yang, but is in fact, yang and yin in 
            English writing, for the white side appears first, or, on the left. The symbol consists of two serpents, white and black,
            entangled with each other; the white serpent eating the tail of the black serpent, and the black serpent eating the tail
            of the white serpent. Both serpents possess a dot of the opposing serpent's color. So what does this symbol mean? 
            No matter the interpretation, yang and yin places a great emphasis on balance, and that the border, or the very middle of the
            two serpents is Dao, the proper way of living. So by balancing the interpretations of the two serpents, one can achieve Dao.
            There are an innumerable amount of interpretations, such as masculine and feminine, life and death, sun and moon, 
            positive and negative, but a better one might be <b>order</b> and <b>chaos</b>. So what are these two things; how do 
            we define order, and how do we define chaos? It's like this: Order is the realm of the known; it's when you know what to
            expect, are familiar with your surroundings, and are relaxed knowing there is a solidarity to your life. When you are in
            order, you can do thing A, expecting thing B, and when you do thing A, then B happens. As it should. Chaos is the realm of the
            unknown; it's when you do not know what to expect, are unfamiliar with your surroundings and find unpredictability as the norm,
            and are anxious knowing that change (too much of it) is imminent. When you are in chaos, you can do thing A, expecting thing B,
            and when you do thing A, thing C happens (which you didn't even know of). What does this mean in the big picture of
            yang and yin? Remembering that each serpent has a dot of the opposing attribute, we begin to understand how chaos fits
            into order and how order fits into chaos. Chaos fits into order because even the most orderly situation is not 100% order;
            there is a tiny potential for change, and that's chaos. If you're walking down the sidewalk and having a pleasant day, at any
            given moment a truck could swerve off the road and hit you&mdash;that's the chaos within order. The same goes for the small
            potential for order to be reestablished in a situation of chaos. Perhaps you are homeless, spending your nights out on the
            streets, and you suddenly find financial stability, and therefore, order, in a winning lottery ticket. So even order
            can manifest itself in the most chaotic scenarios of life. Knowing this, it becomes increasingly evident that maintaining
            balance between order and chaos is paramount to a "well-lived" life, the divine Way. To pursue what is meaningful is
            to chase responsibility, to take on burdens that justify suffering, and in that journey, an individual struggles upon
            the border between order and chaos, perpetually in a state of change and stability, with chaos erupting out of order, and
            order solidifying itself in the face of chaos. That which is meaningful will also always sacrifice the present self for
            the future self. In more Jungian terms, the present self is sacrificed for the Self itself (the fourth Jungian archetype),
            which is defined as the point of balance between unconsciousness and consciousness&mdash;everything that you could be, and
            the manifestation of all potential (everything that could be <b>is</b>). So a good way to gauge expedient decisions
            and actions is to verify if they provide immediate gratification, particularly at the expense of future growth and
            furthering of potential. It is meaningful to take on a challenge, such as reading a difficult book, or analyzing
            a complex research paper, whereas it is expedient to read a three page summary about the writing and make a post about
            your accomplishment of reading the entire thing on social media (which brings us into the next rule).
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>8. Tell the truth&mdash;or, at least, don't lie:</b><br>
            The world becomes much simpler when you tell the truth, for truth indicates a genuine aim. Aim narrows the world, in
            the sense that there is more to focus on, and less to worry about (mostly stemming from the anxiety of not aiming).
            Humans are naturally aiming creatures, and we can see that in the fact that we look each other in the eyes. Since your eyes
            are pointing towards where you find focus (perhaps my eyes in conversation), I look into them to gain a better
            understanding of your intentions, and if you gaze into my eyes, I'm sure you'll find mine. Telling the truth is a very strict
            doctrine, however, and not lying is the next best alternative. Sometimes the truth exists only in a way that will hurt 
            someone without any correlation to constructive criticism, and that is when not lying becomes relevant. Regardless, as
            the individuals that compose society tell the truth more and clearly define their goals, intentions, and aims, the world
            becomes less of a complex monstrosity and much more tameable by the human mind.

            <b>9. Assume that the person you are listening to might know something you don't:</b><br>
            Without this rule, we as individual human beings, drift off to the darkest parts of our pysche and embody our Shadow (Jung).
            The reason why marriage is such a significant interaction and more truthfully, lifelong bond that is made between humans,
            is because people find partners to contend with, to help them grow. Marriages are not "happily ever afters," and for good
            reason. Basic interactions with other people constantly provide feedback for your own growth&mdash;maybe you tell a joke
            to a small group of people, and a crushing silence fills the air immediately. That type of response lets you know that 
            you should perhaps reconsider your sense of humor, or maybe improve your public speaking, or any number of things that pertain
            to changing yourself for the better. Marriage is like taking those basic interactions, but multiplying them hundredfold,
            or even thousandfold, simply because your partner is the same person, and is there for the rest of your life. There is no
            "changing it up" for variation (not speaking sexually, moreso the contending/living with/interacting with part), and the little
            things that annoy you or even the little things that annoy your partner will always persist if nothing is to be done about them.
            First and foremost, listening is something to be done about those annoying things, and genuine listening at that. When you
            live by yourself, you get to do everything the way you want to do it, and that might sound good at first, but it's not at all
            a sustainable solution for the majority of people. You may think that your sanity and your capability to continue sane
            existence is due to an internal competence, that's it's within your psyche, but it's not. In fact, most of your sanity is
            outsourced to other people, those that you interact with, and especially those that you contend with. So although living on
            your own does have its benefits, the ramifications of a it being a long-term arrangement is simply, insanity. You drift off
            towards your weaknesses with no one by your side to get frustrated, or get annoyed, or outright have a discussion with you
            regarding it. And those discussions can't even occur if genuine <b>listening</b> does not happen. By conducting conversations
            with the assumption that the other person has knowledge which you do not possess, you create the potential for yourself to
            learn. The same thing happens when a "textbook" conversation isn't happening. A lecture, for example, requires that the 
            listener understands the precept that the lecturer knows something that he/she does not know. This tiny little precept
            completely rewires how someone thinks in response to words, and to speech; it actually fulfills the capacity to learn. The
            complete and voluntary understanding that those you speak with and those you listen to have knowledge that you do not, is a 
            powerful weapon in the complex journey that is life.

            <b>10. Be precise in your speech:</b><br>
            Speech is another powerful weapon you can wield from your arsenal of "life tools." It is the medium through which
            you communicate to others while maintaining eye contact, and that is no small skill to perfect. Unlike writing, speech
            gives you very little time to think, and that makes it tricky to say exactly what you intend, or what your mind truly
            wants to. By being articulate and addressing exactly what you want to, the world becomes narrower similar in the way
            that having an aim does. While you point with your eyes in the case of an aim, you can point with your speech as well.
            The difference is that your eyes don't have to be trained to look where they want to, while speech is something that can be
            improved, and unlike writing, speech is incredibly dynamic in the moment. It demands the right words, at the right time, with
            the right tone, etc. Speech is the representation of growth in having an aim in and of itself; your eyes dictate where your
            goal is, but your speech requires attention and facilitates growth with its own requirements.

            <b>11. Do not bother children when they are skateboarding:</b><br>
            Although much of what this book leans towards is the respect of elders and their wisdom and stories, it pays homage
            to the power, ambition, and risks that youthfulness represents. Children who skateboard are aware of the risks associated
            with their craft; there can be scrapes, cuts, bruises, and a whole multitude of injuries involved. But children aren't fully
            aware of those risks in the sense that they take part in the sport itself while those that are not children aren't. There
            is a certain beauty to the danger involved in young people taking on dangers that they don't have to. Even though children aren't
            fully aware of risks associated with skateboarding, their actions fully represent the challenges that have to undertaken in the
            face of a miserable existence. And these types of challenges aren't always so easily accomplished, or even so easily started.
            The children that are skateboarding have already begun that adventure, and they're not yet aware that it plays a huge role
            in their journey of life. Interrupting that bold and courageous initiation of risk and reward, the potential of suffering for
            the experience of life, is something uncalled for. Let them do as they wish, and more importantly let the "children" in your
            life continue to "skateboard."

            <b>12. Pet a cat when you encounter one on the street:</b><br>
            This rule reminds me of Jordan's response to "what advice he would give his 16-year-old self." His response was
            something along the lines of "Don't be so high and mighty that you miss the humble opportunities that come your way." I
            think this is great advice not just for young, arrogant teenagers who think they're smart, but also adults that aren't 
            taking all the opportunities that they can, or rather, should. "Cats" exemplify opportunities because they're somewhat
            hidden as a result of existing alongside dogs, the more popular of the two. Whenever the question "cats or dogs?" is
            put forth, dogs always win. Why is that? Well, dogs aren't like cats in their temperament and tolerance for affection and
            attention. More often than not, cats want to be left alone, and dogs are the very opposite. With the same level of analysis,
            we can see that cats take care of themselves better than dogs do (speaking in the pet world of course). Cats simply
            need litterbox training, seldom require walks, and groom themselves meticulously. Dogs, on the other hand, have to be 
            monitored at every waking moment for many months to become potty-trained, are far more energetic than cats and have to 
            go outside, and don't groom themselves to the standard that cats hold themselves do. So what does this have to do with 
            opportunity? Since cats are outshined by dogs, cats are symbolic of the humble opportunities that are often missed, yet hold
            immeasurable value; they eventually take care of themselves, since you taking advantage of an opportunity puts you
            somewhere where you previously weren't! You learn from stepping forwards instead of standing still, so it's better to move
            ahead in an unknown direction than not move at all. Dogs are symbolic of instant, obvious gratification. They satisfy you
            because, well, they're dogs. Dogs are the obvious choice over cats, right? Take the cat over the dog. 
            Give the cat a chance. How will you know unless you give the cat the opportunity?
