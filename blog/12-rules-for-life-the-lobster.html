            12 RULES FOR LIFE: THE LOBSTER
        </h3>
        <h4 style="color:black">
            By: Kevin Feng
        </h4>
        <hr class="line">
        <p>
            Jordan Peterson is often associated with lobsters, those spiny, clawed, and delicious crustaceans we shared
            a common ancestor with over 350 million years ago (the number Peterson presents). The affiliation of the lobster and 
            Dr. Peterson is also present in the form of an internet meme, with images of lobsters telling the viewer to "clean your room" 
            scattered all over the world wide web. All of these lobster-related memes, images, pieces of art, and whatever other 
            crustacean-based paraphernalia people have come up with, originated from this first chapter. It's relatively short, 
            but covers a myriad of topics, including biology, evolution, dominance hierarchies, and everything you need to 
            know in order to be convinced to <b>Stand up straight, with your shoulders back</b>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Dr. Peterson begins his book with an interesting hook, stating "you likely don't think about lobsters, unless you're eating
            them."" This is very true (when do we actively think about lobsters; their primary function to us is delectable food), 
            and by setting up this chapter with the premise that we as humans don't consider lobsters very frequently (especially in
            any objective manner other than sustenance), we realize by the end of it that we should be considering the lobster much
            more frequently because of the practical "human wisdom" that they possess. 
        </p>
        <p>
            As stated earlier, lobsters and modern humans shared a common ancestor over 350 million years, ago even up to 600 million
            years ago. To put it into perspective, there were no trees on Earth when the first lobsters came into being; so that's a
            really, really long time ago&mdash;and that's no insignificant idea to take into account. For lobsters have relatively simple
            neurological pathways, and therefore, simple brains that we have been able to map out to better understand our own complex
            brains and nervous systems. We've found out that lobsters' brains have many similarities to ours, and that lobsters
            respond to neurochemicals in the same way that we do. Most importantly, lobsters respond to serotonin like we 
            respond to serotonin. When our levels of serotonin are high (and octopamine levels are low in comparison), we are more
            confident, happier, and more ready to take on a challenge or fight. Our posture is also improved by higher levels of
            serotonin. It's no stereotypical image to see someone depressed and feel beaten-down slouched over, it's just neuroscience.
        </p>
        <p>
            So what does the lobster have to do with you? After all, they're just simple crustaceans that couldn't possibly be
            as complex as you and I. But that's not true. There are parts of a lobster that are as complex as us, and we are unknowingly
            forgetting about them. Take the lobster dominance hierarchy for example. The top lobsters, the alpha males, are those that
            get the best shelter, the best food, and the best mates. They get prime pick for what territory is theirs, first grabs
            at the small bits of decaying organic matter that falls (marine snow) from the sunlit zone, and the widest selection of
            female lobsters to choose from. That's pretty much everything a male lobster could ask for! But it's not that easy becoming
            top lobster, since there a lot of other lobsters competing for the top spot; any reasonable lobster (and they are reasonable)
            would strive for the top. Well, there can only be one top lobster, so altercations between these ancient, spiny specimens are
            inevitable and happening all of the time. I'm sure right now, two lobsters are duking it out in an epic nephropidaeic duel
            somewhere "under the sea" (yes, Sebastian is a crab, but his design is much more like a lobster, so I'm convinced as such). 
        </p>
        <p>
            How do lobster battles work? They're quite simple, really, just snap, grab, and try to rip off whatever appendage or
            body part of your opponent that you can! This outcome is usually fatal, or at least causes significant injury however, 
            so both parties are predisposed towards not physically battling (as they should). Instead, when two male lobsters meet,
            they size each other up (and posture really matters here); during this phase, many battles are avoided simply because one
            lobster is far smaller than the other, and both parties are fully aware. The smaller lobster scuttles off, knowing that 
            it should back off from a fight that it cannot take. If the altercation is to elevate beyond that point, however,
            the two lobsters communicate using pheromones excreted from their nephrophores, little openings underneath their 
            eyestalks (fun fact: this is how lobsters urinate). The two lobsters gain even more information about each other, as the 
            pheromones can indicate more about a lobster than just their size; perhaps it tells Lobster B that Lobster A has just won
            a fight. This might make Lobster B back off, even knowing Lobster A is a little smaller than him. If the quarrel between
            the two lobsters continues, even after this exchange of urine, the two lobsters begin in actual physical, moving
            interaction. The lobsters alternate charging at one another, in a sort of "fencing" style. Lobster A pushes forward and
            Lobster B backs up. Then Lobster B pushes forward, and Lobster A backs up. This is the final stage before a fight to the
            death. If neither lobster gives up because the opposing lobster's "attacks" were threatening enough, then there really
            is no going back.
        </p>
        <p>
            The two lobsters grapple with each other, using their large, frontal claws to grab at whatever exposed body part they can
            (which isn't as easy as it sounds, lobsters have tough exoskeletons after all). As they grab and push and shove, they're also
            trying to inflict wounds upon the opposing crustacean, mostly by twisting and pulling on an eyestalk that found itself in
            a vulnerable position, or the leg that stuck out just a little bit too wildly. This process is what leads to one-eyed lobsters
            and lobsters missing limbs. It's absolutely brutal for the loser, and incredibly uplifting for the victor. It's also
            no wonder that defeated lobsters aren't able to fight after losing against another male, and it's also why victors are
            more confident in taking on another opponent. This is where the positive feedback loops come into play. 
        </p>
        <p>
            A positive feedback loop is a system in which there is an input, an amplifier, and an output. While negative feedback loops
            tend to stabilize a sitation or some aspect of a larger system, positive feedback loops do the exact opposite (which
            isn't necessarily to "worsen"). Positive feedback loops can get out of hand very quickly because whatever is being inputted
            is coming out at a greater degree, or amplified. This output goes back into the system as an input, and the cycle occurs again.
            Here's an example of a positive feedback loop everybody experiences (remember that positive does not denote "helping"
            or "positive"): You are a farmer, and you are in charge of a herd of cattle. They are fenced in and you don't 
            foresee the cattle escaping. Suddenly, the gate to the cattle enclosure is opened by a lobster who has climbed so high up
            the lobster hierarchy that he now exists on land. Panicked, you run to the gate to herd cattle back into the enclosure 
            with your cattle prod (appropriately named). But as more and more cattle escape, you become more and more panicked. Your
            performance deteriorates as a result of your panic and you aim less accurately with the cattle prod. This decrease in performance,
            in turn, causes even more cattle to escape, and now you can see how this positive feedback loop is working, and that it is
            a harmful one. 
        </p>
        <p>
            What is the positive feedback loop that is applied to lobsters, then? It's surprisingly simple, and as a result,
            we neither consider it nor apply it to our own lives. When a lobster loses a battle, he becomes less inclined to take
            on another opponent, as his serotonin levels dictate lower degrees of confidence, worse posture, and ultimately
            result in less fighting prowess. So when this lobster does take on another opponent, his degraded strength and confidence
            lead him to lose yet another fight, and so on and so forth. The lobster losing actually result in further losses; it's not
            like a societal scenario in which a loss further motivates oneself to perform better (which is common in humans, but
            undeniably does not result in better performance through magic, as serotonin plays a powerful role still). If a lobster 
            were to win however, his serotonin levels increase, his posture is improved (looking larger and more intimidating), and
            his strength is effectively increased. If he wins his next battle (which has a relatively high chance of happening), then
            he climbs up the dominance hierarchy again. With greater success comes greater confidence, and that is a factor that
            cannot be understated when climbing ladders that dictate food, shelter, and mates. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Just as a little anecdote, I have personally experienced this "confidence leading to better performance" dynamic myself 
            (albeit not on the scale of lobsters, which completely changes their lives and leads to the difference between life and
            death). I've recently been infatuated with aim&mdash;and not the type that dictates where you will go in life. I've
            been fascinated with mechanical aim, and more specifically, via a 3D engine. I'm not half bad at aiming myself (though
            I do have a lot to improve), and I've invested time into improving a mechanical skill that I never was too committed to 
            before. I've spent some time in <a href="https://aimlab.gg/">Aim Lab</a>, a free program that lets you train your aim uses
            artificial intelligence (through models like neural networks) to provide feedback and change the tasks for the specific
            user of the application. All tasks are 60 seconds long and involve some type of aiming via a mouse. A score, accuracy,
            among numerous other stats are provided, and these are crucial pieces of data for the AI of the program to process.
            My favorite task by far is Gridshot Ultimate, in which you have to hit as many targets as possible within the allotted 
            minute. There are always three targets present, and they spawn in an invisible grid; when you hit one, another one spawns
            in an open grid slot. To give you an idea of what it's like, I've recorded one of my task completions (which affected
            my performance, but that's to be discussed later):
        </p>
        <div class="iframe-container">
            <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DOqd0RhYPvw" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen>
            </iframe>
        </div>
        <p>
            Now I suspect that this probably looks pretty impressive to the average individual who knows how to use a mouse, but
            doesn't have great accuracy with it, but this recording is actually on the lower end of my performances (watching
            it over, this feels like a 3/10 performance from myself). So what does this have to do with confidence and performance?
            As I mentioned earlier, the fact that this was a recording immediately made my performance worse; I knew that every 
            tiny motion that I was making was being recorded and would exist permanently (in the scope of my lifetime). There's a 
            clear negative correlation between recording and my performance in Aim Lab. In fact, it's this factor that ends up 
            capping my performance to a certain score, and it's most definitely caused by a lack of confidence, something I do not
            want happening in my battles as a lobster.
        </p>

            <figcaption><i>These numbers look inhuman even to me... 186 ms TTK? That accounts for mouse movement time!<br>
                (shoutout to the men of culture who noticed my Steam username)</i>
            </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
            In case you didn't know, the average human reaction time is 284 ms, and the hard cap for human reaction time is supposedly
            200 ms, which I don't believe at all. Based on my reaction time tests (whether it's in Aim Lab or with Human Benchmark),
            I can't be consistently exceeding the "hard cap" by 15-25 ms. My best average reaction time over 20 consecutive trials
            was 176 ms, which leads me to wonder what my fastest reaction time out of those 20 trials was (faster than 150 ms?).
            Either way, I need to stop showing off my superhuman abilities (which they aren't), and get back to why this applies
            to the lobsters and the positive feedback loops.
        </p>
        <p>
            When I complete tasks in Aim Lab (particularly Gridshot Ultimate, which is widely regarded as the golden standard for
            Aim Lab), I am objectively better than a majority of the human population and even people that use Aim Lab and train their
            own aim. Many of my stats (reaction time, TTK, targets hit, etc.) are well above the 90th, even 99th percentile.
            I am a top lobster in terms of aim, even if I can still improve. But what happens when I start recording? 
            Though this is a completely personal issue that results from my personality, my confidence drops when I know I'm 
            being watched, or will be watched in the future. Recording my performance is the simplest way I can both capture
            what I'm doing and completely deteriorate my competence in aim. Interestingly enough, this leads to a harmful
            positive feedback loop, and the harm is twofold. Not only does my score generally have a trend of getting worse and worse,
            my mood gets worse and worse as I get frustrated with my lackluster performance. Each time I see a lower score, a higher
            TTK, fewer targets hit, more misses, and therefore, a lower accuracy, my simple lobster brain understands that I am
            not the top lobster that I once was, and my score continually sinks lower. On the other hand, if I'm not recording,
            I go into Aim Lab with a much more confident outlook, and it's debatable whether or not that confidence is false or not.
            Even Dr. Peterson implies that there is a degree of fake confidence behind starting that helpful positive feedback loop.
            It's not the type of false confidence that ends up deluding yourself, your friends, and family, but it is instead
            the false confidence that you give yourself in order to better yourself genuinely and manifest your talent and unique
            individuality to the tangible world. The small amount of small confidence that you should begin giving yourself
            should not spiral out of control, and it should be replaced by real confidence in long-term aspects of life. 
            Regardless of whether or not my confidence is fake (it's almost certain that some of it is, if confidence is
            quantifiable), my scores climb higher and higher with each task I complete. There's really no significant "warmup"
            factor for Aim Lab either, since I've gotten high scores within my first attempt of the day; you either perform
            or you don't.
        </p>
        <p>
            But the lobster that has good posture and shows off his confidence actually has to interact with others of his
            own species; my aim training isn't a live competition against other people trying to climb the skill ladder of Aim Lab.
            Such a scenario that mostly deals with self-confidence, self-performance, and other levels of "self" is not an
            accurate representation of what the lobster faces. The lobster faces potential opponents, and he does so partially 
            for potential mates. So I'll proffer a scenario in which interaction with others is the entire backbone behind
            the correlating positive feedback loop.
        </p>
        <p>
            Let's say that you are in a public speaking class (something that I've never taken, but have had the equivalent experience
            of being in), and a large portion of the class is to conduct the titular act: public speaking. In a room full of peers,
            your professor, and your own lack or presence of confidence for public speaking, it can be a very tense and pressuring
            environment. When you walk up the aisle to the podium, where the class expects you to talk about the topic your 
            professor gave you, you become anxious&mdash;anxious for your performance, anxious about the class expecting a well-spoken
            speech, anxious about how your ability to speak will influence your grade and trajectory in the class. But you combat
            the anxiety on your way up to the podium, straightening your spine, tilting your chin up, and pushing your shoulders back.
            You don't overexert this attention to posture, remaining relaxed and telling your brain that you are in control.
            In fact, you forget about the anxiety, and the confidence you have in controlling the room with your speech overrides
            that inkling of failure. Right as you speak your first sentence, the audience perks up; you see them come to attention, 
            their eyes fixated upon yours, instead of into blank space, the tonality of your voice as you pose a fascinatingly
            overlooked aspect of life demands respect, and the feedback that your peers give certainly denotes their appropriate
            response. What you might not even realize is that you pick up on the feedback of the audience, every tiny shift in 
            body language, every second of their eyes boring into yours, as well as the more obvious ones, including dead silence (
            the "in awe" type), and applause. Picking up on these miniscule details is your way of feeding input into the
            positive feedback loop that will improve your public speaking. Which isn't to say that negative feedback loops have no role
            in such a scenario; they actually do have a larger role, in the literal sense (that which applies to your mechanical
            ability to speak precisely). When you say Thing A, maybe you are met with applause, so you say that more, and you repeat
            other phrases in the way you said it. But Thing B is met with an awkward silence, and you can clearly tell that
            it is not a stunning silence, but rather one that tells you "that wasn't the right way or right thing to say."
            While Thing A is fed into a positive feedback loop that encourages your good habits and your well-supported, well-spoken ideas,
            Thing B is fed into a negative feedback loop that tells you to tone those things down a bit.
        </p>
        <p>
            However, the positive feedback loop that improves your speech not by mitigating your weaknesses, but by amplifying your strengths
            ties in very well with the other positive feedback loop that boosts your confidence. Evidently, as you say something
            that is met with approval, your confidence not only increases, but your good performance is also augmented further. 
            These two systems are deeply intertwined, and serve as incredibly useful tools in your self-improvement, and the quest 
            that is life. These systems are essentially hard-wired into your brain, and becoming cognizant of them can only
            better your understanding of yourself. You are, after all, the most difficult person to get to know. 
        </p>
        <p>
            As stated earlier, the first lobsters came into being well over 300 million years ago, with us having shared a common
            ancestor somewhere about 350 million years ago. Yet lobsters still exist today, and at a surprisingly socially 
            intelligent level for such an ancient species. Is it possible that there is concrete and biological reasoning for
            our own drives of self-improvement, and of climbing hierarchies of competence?
            Are dominance hierarchies deeply ingrained within our brains, rather than what we call vaguely, our society?
            Are feedback loops nothing but a result of millions of years of evolution, acutely instilled within our nervous systems?
            Perhaps there is something to take away from these questions. Maybe there is a very ancient and profound wisdom that
            the lobster is trying to offer us. Maybe, just maybe, there is something to learn from our spiny-clawed crustacean friend.
