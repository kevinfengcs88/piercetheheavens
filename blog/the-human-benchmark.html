            THE HUMAN BENCHMARK

            <a href="https://humanbenchmark.com/">The Human Benchmark</a> is a site that I've used numerous times in my life and I've already referenced it
            a few times in previous blog posts. In short, it's a site that tests several cognitive abilities of humans through
            modules. One module tests visual reaction time, another tests typing speed. Some modules are designed better than
            others, but in the end, you can always compare your results with the database that the site collects from the trials
            of previous users. Depending on the test, some people will always score higher than others due to factors like age,
            IQ, and genetics (yes, genes can influence performance on technology&mdash;a topic that I plan to explore further
            in a separate post). The Human Benchmark is actively maintained, and although it isn't clear how frequently it's
            updated, it has certainly received entire new modules over the course of the few years that I have used it to
            benchmark my own abilities. I would strongly suggest giving the website a visit; the modules are pretty fun and you
            might learn a thing or two about human cognition and mechanical abilities. 
        </p>
        <p>
            There are currently 8 modules on the site as of this blog post. They are: Reaction Time, Aim Trainer, Chimp tTest,
            Visual Memory, Hearing, Typing, Number Memory, and Verbal Memory. Let's take a look at each one individually and
            assess how valid they are in design.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>1. Reaction Time:</b><br>
            A fairly simple test that I went over in my blog post titled <a href="the-science-of-aim.html">The Science of Aim</a>.
            It's important to note that this reaction time test is designed for visual reaction time, which is much slower than
            auditory reaction time. With auditory reaction time, a stimulus takes around 8-10 ms to reach the brain, whereas a
            visual stimulus takes around 20-40 ms. On top of that, visual reaction time tests conducted through a computer and
            computer screen will inevitably have some variance due to hardware. One of the most significant factors in this
            variance is the refresh rate of the display being used, measured in Hz. A 60 Hz monitor will refresh 60 times per
            second, while a 144 Hz monitor will refresh 144 times per second. There are monitors that go up to 360 Hz, but
            at that point, it becomes practically impossible to discern by human eye. It is generally accepted that 240 Hz can be
            distinguishable from 144 Hz, but not 360 Hz from 240 Hz. The other factor is the processing power of the hardware
            itself (although this factor is much more unlikely to influence results). If the CPU of the computer stutters before
            the visual stimulus is presented, then that can significantly delay the stimulus reaching the brain. This is fairly
            unlikely, however, since the module is very simple and doesn't require much processing power for modern devices. 
            Another potential factor that can influence the results of this reaction time test is the method by which input
            is registered by the user. Since Human Benchmark also works on mobile devices, a user can indicate his/her reaction
            to the stimulus in several ways, such as touchscreen, mouse click, trackpad click, trackpad touch, etc. Relatively
            speaking, this factor isn't that significant towards the outcome. Using a mouse compared to a touchscreen won't make
            or break someone's results.
