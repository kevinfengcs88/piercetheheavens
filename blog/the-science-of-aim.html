            THE SCIENCE OF AIM
        </h3>
        <h4 style="color:black">
            By: Kevin Feng
        </h4>
        <hr class="line">
        <p>
            I have a lot of reasons for writing this column, but the main inspiration for doing so now is my own recent
            improvement in aim. If you haven't read it already, I suggest giving my post about the infamous lobster rule
            <a href="12-rules-for-life-the-lobster.html">here</a> a quick read. In it, I briefly discuss my recent 
            infatuation with "aim," a mechanic that holds a deep philosophical meaning and can be applied in so many areas of life.
            Whether it's physical aiming, like shooting a bow and arrow, or shooting a basketball, or metaphorical aiming,
            like aiming to land a better job, or aiming to be a better person than you were yesterday, I've always taken a profound
            interest to the idea of "aim."
        </p>
        <p>
            In this blog post, I hope to investigate the science of a physical type of aim, and how that can serve as metaphor
            for the natural aim that we possess as human beings. That physical type of aim is one that many of us have been
            forced into refining, spending hours and hours every single day getting better at it, without even realizing it.
            I'm not talking about some type of symbolic aim or a kind of hidden aim that you participate in every day. It's actually
            quite obvious and takes on the most physical representation possible. The aim that I'm describing is the one that
            involves your mouse. 
        </p>

            class="center-image">
            <figcaption><i>No, not that kind of mouse!</i></figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
            Just to confirm, I am talking about your computer mouse, not the furry little rodent that steals your cheese. 
            So what's the connection between aim and computer mice? Simply put, the computer mouse serves as a medium between you
            and your on-screen mouse, or the pointer. Have you ever wondered why the peripherals to your computer are a keyboard
            and a mouse (yes, I know the monitor exists)? It's because they each solve individual problems of communication between
            the user and the computer. While the keyboard takes user inputs, especially through text boxes and macros,
            the mouse exists so that the user can actually "focus" on different modules and points of interaction, hence the name
            "pointer." This also explains why we might describe an application being "in focus." Not only does it literally describe
            that the application is in the foreground and can be interacted with, but also that the application is taking the majority
            of your focus, your attention, and your own aim. Your goals are oriented with the tab, window, script, program, or whatever
            is directly in front of you. You narrow the complex world that is computer screen by simply focusing on one thing at a time.
        </p>
        <p>
            In order to bring applications into focus on your computer, you utilize your mouse (physical) to guide your pointer (digital)
            to where you would like to click (interaction between the physical and the digital). In every sense, the computer mouse
            dictates your aim. Mechanically, your mouse demonstrates how accurate you are at aiming your mouse. Metaphorically,
            your mouse demonstrates what you would like to be focused on. Philosophically, your mouse makes the world simpler, allowing
            you to head towards your goal and find fulfillment in life (pretty crazy, right?). 
        </p>
        <p>
            Well how are we "forced" into refining better mouse aim? Actually, let's first ask: What's so important about mouse aim?
            That's actually quite self-evident. In the 21st century, a technological revolution has forced many (if not all) people
            in first world countries to learn how to use a computer. It's as simple as that. Even blue collar workers have to learn
            how to use computers (maybe a smartphone, especially true in poorer populations) to network, communicate, and stay in touch
            with the rapid pace of the world in the 21st century. Which isn't to say that this technological revolution didn't come
            with any hindrances to our society; there are plenty of ways in which people can become more disconnected with the utilization
            of technology, replacing real social interactions with artificial ones. Additionally, with the COVID-19 pandemic still running
            rampant, the utility of technology and our global connections via the Internet have become even more valuable.
            Computers now enable classes, jobs, churches, clubs, organizations, government, etc. to continue running. Of course, sans
            pandemic, we still rely heavily on computers to keep our world running. It's just that so many institutions have dramatically
            changed with the utilization of technology to fit the demands of this global pandemic. 
        </p>
        <p>
            But why mouse aim? Why not finger accuracy on a touchscreen device? Can't that replicate the same type of efficiency?
            Well finger accuracy certainly can be honed to produce more efficient interaction with technology; I would actually argue
            that touchscreen devices are even more efficient in terms of raw focus via "click interaction" than a computer with a mouse.
            There is no longer a medium between the device and the user, as the human input no longer has to move a pointer across the screen.
            Instead, that pointer is completely and freely manipulated in 3D space&mdash;that is, real space, since your hand exists in the
            tangible world! That sounds fairly obvious, but if you put some thought into it, it makes a lot of sense as to why less skilled
            people often own smartphones over a desktop or laptop. By "less skilled," I'm referring back to the blue collar worker
            statement I made earlier. There's a strong positive correlation between a person's skill and their job, and there's no
            doubt about that. Why else are poor Hispanic households (I'm using this example because I'm the most familiar with it
            in my own life) riddled with smartphone users instead of computer users? Generally speaking, it requires more skill
            to use a computer than a smartphone, and the potential of what computers can do is significantly higher than
            that of a smartphone. Could it be possible that the lack of computer use knowledge is one of the factors driving 
            income inequality (not that I'm calling for the collapse of different incomes by the way; people who perform
            lower skill tasks that are higher in demand should be paid less than those can perform higher skill tasks that are
            lower in demand)? That's a question to be seriously considered. I think it's often overlooked, and besides, I can't
            help but notice the lack of computer usage in these aforementioned poor households and place a potential connection
            between that fact and their financial situations. It's just something to think about.
        </p>
        <p>
            But let's get back to the difference between a real computer and say, a touchscreen device (I haven't ruled
            out touchscreen laptops by the way, but those are certainly not the majority of computers). The first restriction
            of a device like a smartphone or a tablet is its size. I'm not talking about the screen size here (although that
            also is limited in a sense), but the size of the device's case. You might not think of your phone having a case
            per se (an external case is not part of the phone), but it does. The frame of your phone contains everything it needs
            to function properly. Its small size enables so many factors of convenience: it's easy to carry in your pocket, it's
            light enough to toss onto your bed from across the room, and it's generally easy to move around. But that small
            size also comes with several disadvantages, which can really just be summed up into one overarching concept: Potential.
            The potential of a powerful desktop PC is far greater than the potential of a smartphone. There are so many ways
            in which a PC beats an iPhone for example. The PC is faster in everything, can have more memory, more RAM, a better CPU,
            a better GPU, and the list goes on and on. You can play intensive games on a PC that the iPhone cannot handle, you can
            code a script that you just can't do on an iPhone, or you can edit a photo to the point that it no longer looks like the 
            original, while the iPhone is limited to simple things like changing the photo's filter. On top of that, there are
            hidden benefits of a mouse that aren't so intuitive; after all, eliminating a medium between the device and the user
            increases efficiency right? To a certain degree, yes. But compare using Photoshop with a mouse on a computer to 
            using it on a tablet. It's not the same experience, as the precise control over zoom via scroll wheel, complete precision
            with the pointer (you can't see where you're tapping with your big, fat finger; styluses even obscure your vision somewhat), and various macros involving both mouse and keyboard all create a more efficient and precise usage of the photo editing
            software. The fact that both the keyboard and pointing device (mouse) can be used in tandem on a computer is another
            huge advantage over mobile touchscreen devices. Try to highlight any word from this text, copy it, open a new tab,
            and paste it in the search bar. How long did that take? If you're on your phone, it probably took around five to seven 
            seconds or so. You have to click and hold on the text, wait for the text to be selected and the text prompt to come up. 
            Then you click "copy," tap on the tab manager button, add a new tab, click on the search bar to focus it, tap it again 
            for text prompts to come up (although I found that I needed to tap multiple times for it to register), hit "paste" and 
            finally hit "search" or whatever equivalent of "enter" you have on your mobile keyboard. I timed myself performing this 
            simple action and it took me just over seven seconds to do, albeit, the text prompts on the empty search bar required a second
            tap to come up. Had the text prompts came up on the first tap, it likely would have been closer to six seconds. So how
            long does it take to do this on my computer? Less than one second. That's no exaggeration. With your mouse hovering over
            the word in question, press and hold the CTRL key, double-click the word, press the C, T, and V, keys in that order, and
            finish by hitting ENTER. I was able to complete the actions in about half a second, although that's not with a stopwatch
            to keep track. I just know it's well under one second, and half of a second is a good estimate. By selecting the text,
            copying it, opening a new tab, pasting it, and searching for the term without any delay in between each action, it's 
            fairly easy to get this task done in under one second. The only tricky part is hitting ENTER at the end, but since mouse input
            is no longer required by then, your right hand can already be on the ENTER key by the time it needs to be pressed. The whole
            process has very little wasted time and is far more efficient than the process completed on a smartphone. The point is,
            the computer with peripherals of a monitor, keyboard, and mouse triumphs over the touchscreen device, in which the
            only peripheral is the "monitor." You will be using a mouse a lot if you want to get a lot of work done. Period.
            Sorry all you Tumblr iPad artists with your Apple Pencils :).

            This leads me to my emphasis on the importance of mouse aim. Being both precise and accurate at using a mouse
            is crucial for someone interacting with a basic computer setup. But before we get into the deeper details of mouse aim,
            let's define precision and accuracy. They are, after all, two very different things. You may have seen this image
            before:
        </p>
        <figure>
            <img src="https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-03388ae74a51c6544847896b28e09f1b" alt="Precision vs Accuracy" width="800" height="563px"
            class="center-image">
            <figcaption><i>Precision is about being consistent. Accuracy is about hitting the objective.</i></figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
            This image is a very simple and great way to demonstrate the difference between precision and accuracy. As you can tell,
            the high precision instances are in which each trial (a shot or a dart in this target example) is similar in result
            to all other trials. The high precision, low accuracy instance occurs because the shots are consistent, but consistently
            "bad," in the sense that they are not hitting the bullseye or getting close to it. High accuracy instances are in which
            the trials are obtaining the desired result, or at least getting close to it. The high accuracy, low precision instance
            occurs because although the shots are hitting the bullseye and getting fairly close to it, the cluster is fairly wide.
            In other words, the shots were not consistent. Understanding these two cases makes the other two much easier to understand.
            It's very noticeable that the low precision, low accuracy instance has a much larger cluster compared to the 
            high precision, high accuracy instance. But it must also be noted that the low precision, low accuracy instance
            is widely spread out and doesn't hit the goal in mind (yes there is one bullseye hit, but taking the average of the 
            other hits makes that one irrelevant). 
        </p>
        <p>
            Now that we know what precision is and what accuracy is, how do we know if we are being both precise and accurate with
            our mouse? Since the on-screen pointer is a direct representation of your mouse, whatever interactions the pointer
            is involved in can help us determine that. Though it's very easy to conceptualize the idea of "If I'm able to click
            on the 'x' on my window to close it every single time, then I'm precise because I'm consistently clicking it. I'm
            also accurate because hitting the 'x' is my goal. I'm both precise and accurate!" That may be true, but standards
            of precision and accuracy for a computer mouse are relative, especially towards the job in question. Are you an IT
            worker? The standards are pretty high. Are you a blogger rambling about useless topics such as "mouse aim?" The
            standards are fairly low (just kidding). But there are certainly instances in which mouse aim is held to a higher
            standard than others. An obvious one is for competitive first person shooter eSports, but we'll get to that later.
            For now, let's take a look at an example in measuring precision and accuracy (while also incorporating speed) that
            you can try out yourself: 
        </p>
        <p>
            <a href="http://donttap.com">Donttap</a>, also known as White Tile, Don't Tap It! (but most commonly referred to
            just as "donttap") is a simple game in which you click on black tiles. That's it. If you click on a white tile,
            the game is over. It works on mobile devices and computers and has three different modes. For simplicity's sake,
            we'll focus on Frenzy, in which you have 30 seconds to click on as many black tiles as possible. There are
            always three black tiles present in the grid, and when one is clicked, it appears in an "open" (or white) tile. 
            Speed matters, since each black tile clicked will offer one point at a slow APM (actions per minute), but up to five
            at a higher APM. Essentially, the amount of time in between each black tile being clicked and the points given from each
            successful click hold an inverse relationship (but with an upper boundary of five, obviously). To give you a better
            idea of what this 2D aim trainer is like, here's a some of my own footage (OBS, can you please keep up with my
            mouse pointer?):
        </p>
        <div class="iframe-container">

        </div>
        <p>
            How much time have I spent on this, you ask? Not that much (I think :)). I've probably used this website for one hour total,
            over the course of a month or so. I actually don't like it that much because the game ends when you hit a white tile&mdash;as
            a result, accuracy is 100% right? That's not true actually, and that's what I thought initially when I was writing about
            precision and accuracy and planning on making the connection to donttap. Since this is, in essence, a 2D aim trainer without
            any boundaries as to where your mouse pointer can go, you can actually still miss a tile, but not end the game. By clicking
            outside of the game frame, your click won't mean anything to the game frame itself, which is what is in "focus" (see
            where this is going?), and as a result, your accuracy will theoretically diminish. In fact, I do this at around 0:07 in 
            the video to demonstrate (I know, my aim is just that good, I can even control when I mess up *sarcasm*). 
        </p>
        <p>
            Remember when I mentioned that touchscreen devices, namely your mobile devices, like a smartphone or tablet, have
            specific advantages over mouse and keyboard (albeit very few)? Donttap is one example in which a touchscreen device wins
            out on "aim." I don't remember exactly how, but I found out that donttap worked on mobile, so I opened it up on my iPad and
            gave it a go. On my very first try, I got a score over 800. To get a score over 800 on my computer, it took at least ten tries!
            But then again, that's not considering the fact that it's practically impossible to prematurely end the game on a touchscreen.
            With basic hand-eye coordination, donttap on a mobile device is not a game of accuracy, but a game of speed. All that
            matters is how fast you go, since you have multiple fingers hovering over each tile; missing just doesn't happen. But what
            about precision? Interestingly enough, donttap isn't so focused on precision, though it is involved. Since precision is being
            able to achieve the goal, or hit the theoretical "bullseye," donttap's inherent design doesn't care so much about precision.
            Sure, you have to hit the tiles themselves, but they're fairly large, and besides, points aren't awarded based on how close
            to the exact center of a tile your clicks were&mdash;they're based on speed. The way that precision matters in donttap is
            when you end the game prior to 30 seconds elapsing, or hitting a white tile. When that happens, your precision is lowered.
            Unfortunately, for our goal of measuring precision itself, we can't measure it past that point. You are either 100% accurate 
            (to the game's design, since it doesn't care if you hit the outer edges of the black tiles or the exact centers), or you are
            (1/black tiles hit * 100)% precise, where the number 1 represents how many white tiles were clicked, which will always be one
            in this case. Just to clarify, these precisions are calculated with the game's inherent design being taken into consideration.
            We aren't concerned with raw precision, with 100% indicating that you hit only the centers of black tiles, but instead,
            a subjective precision that is dictated by what the game's one mode of measurement (the score) is.
        </p>
        <p>
            So clearly, donttap does require precision (clicking on black tiles rather than white tiles) and accuracy (clicking on
            black tiles with the assumption that white tiles are not the "goal"). In fact, it requires precision and accuracy in
            such a way that can easily be applied to the general use of a computer. In donttap, you have to move your mouse pointer
            to what is essentially a button, like one you would find on practically any interface, and then click (the faster,
            the better). It's so similar that using donttap will effectively increase your efficiency on computers, and on your
            setup especially. Even though there are many differences between your computer setup and the one at the public library
            (such as monitor resolution, refresh rate, and size, as well as mouse DPI, OS sensitivity, and the physical properties
            of the mouse itself), increasing your competence with any computer certainly improves your efficacy with computers
            in general. The importance of this statement cannot be understated, and will be a main point for my touch typing
            article that I plan on writing (or rather typing, haha). 
        </p>
        <p>
            Now that we've gone through a lot about 2D aim, we should ask, "What's so different about 3D aim?" Well to no surprise,
            it's wildly different from 2D aim. When you move your mouse in a 3D render, your mouse no longer correlates to a mouse
            pointer; instead, your mouse controls what is essentially a camera. As you move your mouse to the left, for example,
            the background pans in such a way that your screen displays a "camera" rotating to the left. Obviously, the amount that
            the POV will pan to the left depends on sensitivity, but this sensitivity feels completely different compared to a
            pointer moving across your screen. For the most part, 2D aim and 3D aim are incomparable. It is arguable that having
            better 2D aim will improve your 3D aim, or vice versa, due to mouse control, but not because of any similarities held
            between the two, visually speaking (basically improving one type of aim will only improve your aim in the other type
            if you've developed a better control over your physical mouse). 
        </p>
        <p id="anchor1">
            Now unlike 2D aim, 3D aim has relatively little application to real life. While improving your 2D aim is without a doubt,
            a worthwhile endeavor (as you will become more efficient with your mouse clicks and save countless hours in the long run), 
            improving your 3D aim won't help you perform your office job faster, for example. Though there certainly are benefits
            that come with improving your 3D aim, they're just not as self-evident as those that come with improving your 2D aim.
            Though you may improve your hand-eye coordination or just gain a better understanding of real life surroundings (trust
            me, I know some people that could use 3D aim trainers so they stop bumping into things in the real world) with practicing
            3D aim, the difference it makes is marginal. Besides, why train 3D aim when 2D aim exists&mdash;something that seemingly
            matters in the real world, which is still in a technological revolution? Perhaps the results of things like these
            don't actually have to be pragmatic:

            Rasputin was quite the freaky Russian monk. You may have already seen this 3D aim trainer, called 
            <a href="https://aimlab.gg">Aim Lab</a>, in my blog post entitled 
            <a href="12-rules-for-life-the-lobster.html">12 Rules for Life: The Lobster</a>. I discuss the basics of Aim Lab there.
            The specific task that is being performed in this video is Gridshot Ultimate, in which targets exist on a Cartesian plane.
            Three exist at any given time, and clicking on one will spawn it elsewhere on the grid. Points are rewarded for hitting a
            target, with the points varying depending on factors like speed (how long it took you to go from one target to the next), 
            and probably many more factors that I'm not even aware of. Points are also deducted for missing a target, so a high
            accuracy is crucial for a high score. I really like Aim Lab because it looks very polished, the 3D engine is efficient
            (my laptop isn't that powerful), has useful statistics to help you improve, and most importantly, it has neural network
            tasks and other AI implementations in the workings. Though a task like Gridshot Ultimate is constant, meaning your
            performance doesn't influence the static nature of the task (but Aim Lab will tell you if you are weak on your right
            side, for example), there are tasks that change in response to everything that you do. Every single click, movement,
            misclick, etc. will change the task so that it better suits your needs. I find that to be a promising sign for the
            potential of artificial intelligence. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Rewatching this video, I'm not exactly sure how to describe it. I do think to a certain degree it's "inhuman," meaning
            it surpasses the standard perception of what a human being is capable of. Frankly, I can't ever accept that I was able
            to "do that" when looking back on the recordings ever. It just seems impossible in a way that is hard-capped by the
            human body. In some ways these types of things are inhuman, but at the same time, they're precisely what define
            humans. We would not be the same species we are today if we didn't defy all the limitations that we imposed on ourselves
            at some previous point in time. Whether it was the outright denial of human beings ever taking flight, or the 
            staunch doubt that people would never go into space, anything that indicates a limit is eventually shattered. And that
            really isn't blind naivety, although in a short time frame it might be considered foolish. In the big picture, or the 
            long, foreseeable future of humanity, it then becomes foolish to accept the reality of the "impossible." Time dictates
            that it won't be (impossible). I plan on exploring this topic further in a series of articles pertaining to 
            the theory of impossibility.  
        </p>
        <p>
            Straying away from the philosophical implications of this recording, let's break down the relationship between
            the physical world and what is being registered on-screen in the most literal sense. What's happening in the physical,
            tangible world is fairly simple. There is a computer mouse with someone's hand on it, controlling its movement and inputs.
            The person moves his/her hand while grasping the mouse, which then relays a response to the computer. What we see as a
            result of this physical mouse movement on-screen is the panning of the first person camera in the relative direction
            that the mouse moved. Depending on sensitivity, the screen will alter by a certain angle (in 3D space of course). DPI, 
            or dots per inch, is a measurement of your mouse's hardware sensitivity. The higher your DPI, the more sensitive your
            mouse. Software sensitivity, such as the mouse settings in your operating system, or the sensitivity in the settings
            of a 3D engine, is multiplied by your DPI to give eDPI, or effective dots per inch. This is most commonly used with 3D
            engines rather than OS sensitivity, as OS sensitivity is measured very inaccurately, and quite frankly, very primitively.
            Windows 10, for example (and maybe previous versions of Windows), has 11 different mouse sensitivities. That's it.
            You can have anything from 1 sensitivity (more commonly notated as 1/11) to 11 sensitivity (11/11). Although I'm not
            bashing on operating systems for not having precise sensitivity customization, I want to make it clear that it's not 
            conventional to multiply a Windows sensitivity of 4 (on their supposed "slow" to "fast" scale) with the DPI of a mouse.
        </p>
        <p>
            But what even enables this sequence of events in the physical world to play out over those 60 seconds? Is there a single
            reason that explains to what degree how "connected" the human hand is with the computer mouse? Though I think visual and
            cognitive competence is required for any useful connection between hand and mouse, undoubtedly, mouse control is
            the most important aspect of aim.
        </p>
        <p>
            To be clear, mouse control is different from person to person, and much of the preference when it comes to mouse
            control has been divided into categories of mouse grip&mdash;the style in which someone holds a computer mouse. 
            Interestingly enough, mouse grip isn't just jargon that serves no meaning to anyone who isn't a computer enthusiast;
            it actually has meaningful impact on anyone's ability to control a mouse, depending on the style. It's widely considered
            that there are three main types of mouse grips: (1) Palm, (2) Claw, and (3) Fingertip. 
        </p>
        <figure>
            <img src="https://bestgamingmicegrip.weebly.com/uploads/4/2/3/1/42317045/757056585.png?799" alt="Mouse Grips" width="1000" height="440px"
            class="center-image">
            <figcaption><i>The three main mouse grips.</i></figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
            Now you may be wondering which mouse grip you use, but it goes without saying that there are other mouse grips aside
            from these, whether they are combinations of these or not. For example, if you think you use a palm grip, but realize
            that only part of your fingers rest on the mouse, then you might be using a hybrid grip in between palm and claw. It's
            most likely that you're using palm, claw, or something in the middle of the two. They're both relatively intuitive, as
            a palm grip gives you a naturally good grip on the mouse, and your fingers don't get too tired while they rest on 
            the mouse, and a claw grip (theoretically) gives even more control as you exert more force through your fingertips
            and each time you click, you exert force straight down, on the same axis that your phalanges run (as opposed to
            a palm grip, in which each mouse click involves the action of pushing your entire finger down while it is parallel
            to the mouse button). Lastly, a fingertip grip is something like a combination of the two, but with the entire hand
            shifted backwards, so that the palm does not contact the mouse. In the diagram above, the fingertip grip is the only
            grip that does not have the palm in contact with the mouse (contact points represented with a green highlight), and
            as a result, has the least surface area contact out of the grips. If you're curious as to what percentages of people
            use which mouse grip, many surveys have been conducted that clearly show most people use palm, followed by claw,
            followed by fingertip. But many of these surveys are flawed in the sense that hybrid grips are not accounted for; I
            personally use a palm grip as my default, but depending on the size of the mouse I'm using, I "claw up" more. My current
            mouse is slightly smaller and much lighter than my previous one, so I use a hybrid grip between palm and claw. What
            would I vote had I participated in one of these surveys? I probably would have voted palm, even though that's not entirely
            true. But this ambiguity leads me to think about how many other people don't fall perfectly into one of the three mouse
            grips and, as a result, pick inaccurately. Regardless, the number of people who do so shouldn't skew the order of
            dominance amongst the three grips, but they can certainly alter the percentages themselves. In one 
            <a href="https://www.strawpoll.me/690830">straw poll</a> conducted in 2014, 44% of participants preferred a palm grip,
            31% picked claw, and 25% chose fingertip. A similar result was found in another unconfirmed survey, with 54% for palm,
            26.5% for claw, and 19.5% for fingertip (the source apparently doesn't know how to add up to 100%). But do these
            results indicate that a palm grip is the best? In a way, yes, and at the same time, not necessarily. A palm grip
            is the "best" since it is the default grip that everyone uses, and the fact that people who take mouse aim
            seriously still stick to it is certainly a testament to its tried-and-true nature. But it also has to be considered
            that a palm grip results in less control over actually inputting clicks, as it is more straining to push your entire
            finger down while it is parallel to the mouse button than to do so when it is perpendicular. There are also many
            more facets of aiming that are influenced differently based on mouse grip as well as preference of those mouse grips;
            essentially, mouse grips should be looked at with a perspective of preference, rather than optimization (unless
            you are certain that one mouse grip is better even if you do not like it, but then again, making that switch comes
            down to your own decision, otherwise known as your preference). 
        </p>
        <p>
            I think Aim Lab is a great way to introduce these facets of aiming. Even though Aim Lab is only accounting for 3D
            aim, we have to remember that whatever happens on a 3D engine and qualifies as a "variant" or "facet" of aiming also
            applies to general mouse control. That is, the physical computer mouse is a realization of those specifics of aim.
            Even if Aim Lab is a 3D engine, the statistics that it tracks can still be applied to your own mouse efficiency, whether
            in a 3D engine or not. In theory, there are infinite facets of aim, but Aim Lab focuses on six and calculates them
            as numbers on a scale of 0-100 for simplicity's sake.
        </p>

        <p>
            The six stats are (1) Flicking, (2) Tracking, (3) Speed, (4) Precision, (5) Perception, and (6) Cognition.
            What do they all mean? I'm glad you asked.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>1. Flicking</b><br>
            Flicking is probably the most important aspect of aim. It is essentially the action of adjusting your aim
            to the desired target. The ideal flick involves a single, swift movement that takes the shortest path from
            the initial location (of your pointer, crosshair, etc.) to the target, followed by the appropriate input as soon as 
            possible. The essence of aim is flicking; its definition alone defines how you define your target, and subsequently,
            strive for it, and ultimately, obtain it. It's also called "flicking" because the movement of your hand and mouse is
            a "flick," or a movement from Point A to Point B on your mousepad. Take the example of closing a tab in your browser
            window, for example. Go ahead and open a new tab (if you don't use the associated keyboard shortcut, then you've
            already flicked :)). Move your mouse somewhere near the 'x' to close it, but not on the 'x' itself. Now close the tab
            with the 'x' button. Congratulations! You just performed a flick with your mouse! In fact, you've probably been
            flicking your mouse pointer around the whole day without realizing it. Two other great examples of flicking
            are donttap and Gridshot Ultimate from Aim Lab. The big difference between closing a tab with the 'x' button and
            these two tasks is that the former requires a mousepress event, whereas the latter require a mousedown event. 
            A mousepress event involves the user clicking down on the mouse while aiming properly at the target in question and also
            releasing the click "up" while still on target. A mousedown event is much more convenient, as it only requires
            the user to click down while on target. You can easily test this out with <a href="../aimdrill.html">Aim Drill</a>,
            a little module that I've spent some time coding together. It's not totally functional as of this post going up,
            but you can definitely tell that mousedown events are used instead of mousepress events. If you try and click
            and hold on one of the targets in the grid, it will respond instantly. Whereas if you click and hold on the 'x' button
            that closes the tab, the tab won't close until you release the mouse button (while still hovering over the 'x').
            Mousepress events allow you to "regret" (as someone described it in a Stack Overflow reply), by clicking and holding,
            moving your pointer away from the target, and then releasing the mouse button. Flicking is the gold standard of aim.
            If your mouse pointer, crosshair, or whatever aiming indicator is in use isn't already on the target, you have to
            flick to it. Think about it like this: How many times does the button you need to press "spawn" underneath your cursor?
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>2. Tracking</b><br>
            You probably don't have to perform much tracking on an everyday basis. Although flicking can involve moving
            targets (you can account for the point at which your aim and the target will meet, depending on speed, the next
            statistic we'll discuss), tracking is completely dependent on moving targets. As a result, you likely need
            no aptitude for tracking on a daily basis. Tracking involves simply maintaining your aim on a moving target.
            Depending on the context, holding down a mouse input may be appropriate, but in general, tracking is just
            the constant adjustments made to aim to stay on a moving target. That's it.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>3. Speed</b><br>
            I definitely have a lot more to say about speed, and we're not talking about the controlled substance here. 
            Now speed isn't to be confused with reaction time, otherwise known as perception by Aim Lab's standards. Speed
            is the measure of how fast your aim itself is; it is not the delay in milliseconds it takes you to start moving
            once a target appears on your screen (that's reaction time), but it is instead the time it takes you from once
            you recognize the target (perceive it, thus the title, perception) to actually hitting the target. This speed can
            be measured in milliseconds, but to be frank, it depends completely on the task at hand. Reaction time has a standard
            measurement of milliseconds because it is universal across all tasks (assuming the same type of reaction time:
            visual, auditory, touch stimulus, etc.). Speed, though an aspect of aim, isn't so much of a "style" of aim like
            flicking and tracking are. Speed is somewhat of a "modifier" that is applied to these styles of aim. Whereas
            flicking and tracking don't find much intersection, flicking and speed or the combination of tracking and speed
            find complete intersection. You can flick quickly, or you can flick slowly. You can track quickly, or you can
            track slowly. Evidently, faster is better, so long as you don't sacrifice accuracy for that speed. Interestingly
            enough, we don't see "accuracy" as a statistic here. But we do see the other concept that we discussed earlier
            as the next aspect of aim.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>4. Precision</b><br>
            Even though accuracy isn't considered a facet of aim itself, it is involved in every Aim Lab task. For Gridshot,
            your accuracy is simply the number of targets hit divided by the number of clicks. For tracking tasks, the accuracy
            percentage is calculated with the time spent on the target(s) divided by the total time of 60 seconds. So why isn't
            accuracy considered its own aspect of aim? I can think of a few reasons, namely the fact that accuracy from task
            to task can vary greatly. Perhaps 95% accuracy on one task is unimpressive while 80% accuracy on another is
            quite an accomplishment. On the other hand, precision is valued in a more constant sense (ie. from task to task,
            high precision is generally regarded as "good," with little variance). Precision, as we discussed earlier, is
            the measurement of being consistent. If being consistent means slowing down significantly (decreasing speed) in order
            to hit the exact center of every single target, then so be it; that increases precision, since your performance is
            consistent with each trial (where on each target you click). Though it may seem difficult to imagine how precision
            is calculated in your head, it's best to consider the opposite ends of the "precision spectrum." If you take a look
            at my <a href="#anchor1">Gridshot video</a> and jump to the end, you'll notice that there is a percentage associated
            with precision. I've noticed that I always get 84% or 85%, but what does that even mean? The simplest way to understand
            this value is not ponder over how the value itself was calculated, but rather what 0% and 100% precision would mean. 
            A 100% precision would mean that every single hit was the same in relation to the target. If you hit the leftmost pixel
            of the target everytime you clicked, for example, then you would have complete precision. Precision doesn't have to
            involve a large volume of inputs, either. In theory, a single input on a target for the whole 60 seconds equates to
            complete precision as well (although I'm not sure about Aim Lab's exact algorithms for calculating precision). 0%
            precision is a bit harder to conceptualize; in theory, it can only be obtained by not making any inputs at all (But
            then isn't that 100% precision, since you consistently did nothing?). Regardless of this paradox, higher precision
            means being more consistent, and that is a good thing for strive for if your actions are already "good," whether
            in aim or not. 
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>5. Perception</b><br>
            Perception is reaction time. That's all it is. Of course, reaction time can vary slightly depending on the stimulus,
            but in general, reaction time is a fairly static concept. As mentioned before, reaction time is measured in
            milliseconds (ms). In general, the average human reaction time to a visual stimulus is somewhere around 250 ms, but
            Human Benchmark seems to disagree (as do I), with its average score falling closer to 225 ms. You can try out their
            reaction time test <a href="https://humanbenchmark.com/tests/reactiontime/">here</a>. You get five trials, in which
            you wait for the screen to turn green and click as fast as you can once it does. The average of these five trials is
            your final score, and is a good indication of your general reaction time in ms. I've heard numbers as low as 215 ms
            being considered average, but honestly anything below or equal to 215 ms is pretty good, with 200 ms being very good. 
            As far as I can recall, my final score usually falls around 175 ms. As I was writing these few sentences, I gave it
            a go just for fun, and I honestly surprised myself. I expected something around 186 or 187 ms.
        </p>
        <img src="reactiontime.PNG" alt="Human Benchmark reaction time" width="1000" height="600px" class="center-image">
        <p>
            Funnily enough, I realize that this is nowhere near my fastest reaction time (and I do mean as an average over
            a number of trials). Aim Lab has its own reaction time test, and it's slightly different from that of the Human
            Benchmark. Still rendered in a 3D engine, the Detection task will simply spawn a target in your immediate field of
            vision (FOV). Once you see it, you click (you do not have to hit the target, just click wherever your crosshair is). 
            This occurs 20 times, and the final score (measured in milliseconds) is an average of those 20 trials. To this
            day, I still have no idea how I accomplished this.

            I have to keep reminding myself that this score of 153 ms is averaged over TWENTY TRIALS. It really does seem
            inhuman when you consider that the lowest out of the trials almost had to have dipped below 150 ms. The "false
            alarms" category just counts how many times you click when there is no target on screen, something that
            the Human Benchmark's test does not penalize you for (if you click while the screen is still red on the Human
            Benchmark, it just warns you that you clicked too soon). The way that reaction time (or perception) is factored
            into aim is very simple: lower reaction time means less time spent hitting a target. Take the time to kill (TTK)
            measurement from the advanced page of Gridshot Ultimate (click <a href="#anchor1">here</a> to jump back to
            the video). TTK is a combination of speed and perception, as first, you need to react to a target spawning
            on screen (this also applies when a button appears on screen in your browser and you go to click it), and then
            you have to move your aim indicator (crosshair, pointer, etc.) to it and make an input. Perception + speed = TTK
            essentially. It's also important to note that reaction time is the most difficult aspect of aim to train out of
            these six categories. Factors like age and genetics play the biggest role in determining a fast reaction time. 
            I'd like to pursue this topic further with blog posts about what defines human (and therefore, what defines
            the inhuman), as well as the genetics behind eSports professionals (Are they genetically superior like an NBA
            player is, or do they just practice a lot?).

            <b>6. Cognition</b><br>
            I have the least to say about cognition. At the same time, I could have the most to say about cognition
            if I did a lot of research into cognitive science. The definition of cognition itself encapsulates anything involving
            mental action, and our understanding of the brain and the mind is still fairly limited. In a sense, cognition is the
            omnipresent factor of aim, for the simple fact that it is an overarching concept for anything related to the mind.
            Whether you need to flick, track, be fast at those two things, aim for the center of targets over and over, or just
            naturally react to a visual stimulus, cognition plays some role. Out of all these facets of aim, cognition is something
            of an enigma. The examples for cognition can fall into anything in theory, but Aim Lab tends to focus on certain
            tasks that place emphasis on decision-making. An example of an Aim Lab task is Decisionshot (which has been
            changed since Aim Lab's earliest days). It involves hitting a center target (it will always spawn in the exact
            middle of your FOV) that is either red or blue. After clicking on it, it will disappear and two targets will spawn.
            One will be red, and the other will be blue. Your task is to click on the one that corresponded to the color of the
            center target you just hit (back in the beta, only one target would show up, so it was more of a trigger discipline
            scenario, as you would have to just wait until the new target disappeared until another center target spawned). The
            focus of cognition tasks seems to involve more mental activity than simply clicking on a target. The tasks
            can get more complicated, with tasks that flash more than five targets of varying colors, only to spawn them in with
            one of the targets having changed its color. Your goal in that scenario is to click on the one that changed color.
            It's rather fast-paced and is much more difficult than it sounds; it is certainly much harder than the basic
            one-dimensional decision that goes behind distinguishing between Decisionshot's red and blue targets.

            So that's the science of aim, or rather, just the surface of this complex topic that arose with the 
            Information Age and the rise of the computer. Looking back on the topics that we've discussed, it becomes evident
            that we've truly only scratched the surface. I delved into the philosophical implications of aim, but did not
            go in depth with the significance of aim to moral and religious texts (which there most certainly are). I went into
            a brief summary about mouse grips, but did not nearly cover the topic to its full extent (more hybrid grips, mouse
            shape and size, how to deal with hand or finger fatigue, etc.). I also used Aim Lab's six dimensions of aim to
            introduce the concept of "multi-faceted aim," or the idea that aim isn't a simple practice that can't be broken
            down into individual aspects. But those six metrics alone already presented their own flaws (What effect would accuracy
            have if it were a main statistic on its own? What about pre-aiming, commonly referred to in 3D engines as
            crosshair placement?) and lead us to question how many more different aspects of aim could exist, and if there is a tier
            list of importance, or utility that each one provides. This is just the beginning.
