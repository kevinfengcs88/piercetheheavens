            A CRITICISM OF THE LOBSTER 
        </h3>
        <h4 style="color:black">
            By: Kevin Feng
        </h4>
        <hr class="line">
        <p>
            The first chapter of Jordan Peterson's bestseller book <i>12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos</i>, has received
            its fair share of criticism regarding its inaccurate statements regarding lobsters. If you haven't read my post about
            my take on Peterson's "lobster rule," I suggest you take a gander <a href="12-rules-for-life-the-lobster.html">here</a>.
            Much of what Jordan has to say about lobsters is summarized in that column, and I present his claims as if they were facts.
            However, after doing a little bit of research, it's quite clear that Jordan's first chapter isn't as perfect as it may seem.
        </p>
        <p>
            Dr. Peterson's incredibly straightforward and highly-motivating speeches, conversations, lectures, etc. had already
            taken the world by storm a few years ago (especially when he opposed Bill C-16). His audience consisted (and still does) of
            young men, desperate for wisdom and guidance, born and lost in a very radical time period in which men are outright told
            that they have self-evident criticism for a biological aspect over which they had no control. Peterson marketed himself 
            very well, appearing on several podcasts that had large, young, impressionable male audiences, including the Joe Rogan
            Experience, the H3 Podcast, and the Rubin Report. The result? A massive following that improved the lives of millions of
            lost people, regardless of their gender. Unfortunately, the trap that is created by this phenomenon is one that
            Peterson never discusses directly, and is upon the viewer's responsibility to learn: Not everything Jordan says is correct.
            Though this is an obvious statement (especially if you disagree with him), as you can insert the name of any person into 
            this sentence, it's particularly important in the case of an intellectual sensation like Dr. Peterson. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I can't speak for everyone, but I know I can speak for a large majority of Peterson's followers: When you first discover
            Jordan, you believe that his word is the literal truth. His arguments are simple (which isn't necessarily bad, I'm
            just highlighting the brevity of them), he supports his claims with facts (which we are going to criticize), and his speech
            and writing are incredibly easy to understand (his writing even parallels that of his speaking style, but as it is writing,
            it is inevitably more complex). In the end though, he provides wisdom that people aren't getting. Peterson noticed this
            lack of wisdom himself, and summarized as people being "fed nothing but rights," which, to a certain degree, is true.
            Peterson then uses this lack of responsibility and this surplus of rights to indicate that there is a lack of wisdom, and
            clearly prove that young people are missing out on the meaning of life. Just listening to Jordan bestow much-needed wisdom
            through his speech is truly an intoxicating experience for many young people's first times hearing him, and that's where
            the danger lies.
        </p>
        <p>
            The best way I can describe this danger was the uneasiness I felt when reading or listening to criticisms about Dr. Peterson
            around the time that I had first discovered him. It's a strange emotion, and I'm glad that I felt uneasy because I was thinking
            something like, "No! There's absolutely no way that Jordan is wrong! He can't have any fair criticism! He's perfect!" Looking back
            on it, I can now appreciate how I avoided danger by ceasing to see Jordan as a perfect human being, someone too wise and intelligent
            to be so low as to even face criticism. 
        </p>
        <p>
            But now that I've given myself a few years to do reading, writing, research, or just walk further through the journey
            of life, I now understand how foolish I was to praise Dr. Peterson so narrowly (Jordan is still an awesome guy,
            and those who believe that he is their enemy are simply foolish). Especially now that I'm giving his
            second book a second read, the experience feels much more genuine. I notice mistakes (an esoteric word used twice
            within the span of a page that could have been replaced by a synonym), I realize awkward/informal phrasing that works
            well in speech, but can only be used so many times in such formal writing and maintain its effect, and most importantly,
            I'm picking out areas that Jordan can be criticized on. Which leads me to something that I wish Dr. Peterson would 
            emphasize more to his young and impressionable audience&mdash;that you should always listen, read, and experience the world
            as if it is wrong. Considering that the word of Jordan is wrong, rather than correct, incites honest thinking that 
            facilitates the growth of the listener. Evidently, this applies to everything (with some topics taking it to a 
            lesser degree), as taking what you hear or what you read as the absolute truth without considering its potential for 
            error is plain ignorance. With that being said, let's take a closer look at why Dr. Jordan Peterson's stories about the 
            lobster are more like the Bible than a chemistry textbook.
        </p>
        <p>
            I've mentioned briefly in <a href="12-rules-for-life.html">my first blog post</a> that Jordan emphasizes the
            multifaceted definition of "truth." The main differentiation that is to be noted is the duality of truth when it comes
            to fiction and nonfiction. For example, a fictional work, such as the Bible, is filled with stories that hold up
            the substructure of western culture, and for good reason: the stories within it are invaluably true, and not in a
            factual sense. The stories in the Bible are true in the sense that there is a moral, or life lesson to be derived from
            them. Whether it's Cain and Abel or Noah's Ark, the stories of the Bible are undoubtedly false in the factual, empirical,
            and scientific sense, but are undeniably true in what they have to teach us in morality, self-improvement, and philosophy.
        </p>
        <p>
            So what does this have to do with the first chapter of <i>12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos</i>? Peterson
            never prefaces this chapter with a forewarning of scientific inaccuracies being present, but then again,
            the Bible doesn't either. Though Jordan's intentions are to provide a factual passage regarding lobsters,
            he ends up making several empirical mistakes, albeit, nothing too crazy when considering the value that can be
            derived from reading the chapter as if it knows something that you don't (shoutout to Rule #9). Essentially,
            Dr. Peterson's book is like the Bible when it comes to its fallacies&mdash;it may not offer valid facts, but
            it certainly provides a deep philosophical thought that should be considered.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Lobsters and humans share a common ancestor that existed around 350 million years ago.</b><br>
            This statement is not true. Which doesn't immediately discredit Dr. Peterson's point in Chapter One, but it
            definitely raises the question of whether or not any of his "facts" are true (plot twist: they're mostly accurate).
            The ancestors of modern lobsters started appearing around 350 million years ago, and those are relatively recognizable.
            However, the earliest ancestors of lobsters appeared closer to half a billion years ago, and are terrifyingly
            unrecognizable:
        </p>
        <figure>
            <img src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZPS7FcrLeqs-Zw2TKewiKgLif6c=/0x119:2805x1989/920x613/filters:focal(0x119:2805x1989):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/45867098/3._Aegirocassis_benmoulae_reconstruction_black_background.0.0.jpg" alt="Aegirocassis benmoulae" width="1000" height="563px"
            class="center-image">
            <figcaption><i>Aegirocassis benmoulae was 7 feet long, dwarfing anything else in the ocean at the time!</i>
            </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
            To add on, lobsters are invertebrates, while we are vertebrates, meaning they do not have a backbone, while we do.
            Since vertebrates first appeared over 500 million years ago, that raises a concern as to how we are connected to lobsters.
            The common ancestor of a vertebrate and an invertebrate has to be some species that originated over half a billion years ago.
            While Peterson implies that the relationship between lobsters and humans is fairly close, and as a result, neurologically
            as well, the truth of the matter is that lobsters and humans are quite different. However, Jordan doesn't directly
            state that humans are closely related to lobsters; rather he points out the similarities and develops his argument based
            off of that. Nevertheless, it's disappointing to see a blatantly incorrect claim in Jordan's writing. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Dr. Peterson's comparison of the lobster's nervous system and the human nervous system has been interpreted somewhat
            askew in the eyes of many critics. He never claims that the nervous systems of the two species are very similar, but instead
            brings to attention the simplicity of the lobster's nervous system. In fact, the simplicity of nervous systems of other
            species has led to many breakthroughs and discoveries in the neurological field. In simple terms (like that of the
            lobster's nervous system), we can study the anatomy of a species with a fairly basic nervous system, track similarities
            with that of our own, and make conclusions. The significance of serotonin in humans and lobsters, as well as antidepressants
            working on both of the species cannot be understated. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Now that we understand how Jordan Peterson's argument is flawed, what are we left with? Is the entire chapter invalidated
            now? Well, not really. As I mentioned earlier, there are two different types of validation: one that comes from 
            nonfiction, and one that comes from fiction. But Dr. Peterson's chapter is something of an enigma when only taking
            into consideration these two types of truth. It isn't necessarily nonfiction, as we just disproved some aspects of 
            his argument, but it isn't outright fiction either. Jordan doesn't write the chapter knowing that it is false or has
            the intention of writing the passage as an explanation for questions that we don't have the answers to (religious texts).
            Instead, it's somewhere in the middle; it exists as a text that is based in both scientific truth and a bit of
            scientific stretching of the truth. We know that invertebrates and vertebrates can't possibly have a common ancestor
            so recently, and we also know that the nervous system of the lobster isn't that similar to the human nervous system (although
            it's debatable whether or not Dr. Peterson is trying to make that point, as I believe he doesn't directly state that), so
            how valid is this chapter, and thus, this rule? Well, it's as valid as the Bible. It's also as valid as your chemistry textbook.
            It's also as valid as your english writing professor, and just as valid as a friend offering some advice&mdash;which is to say
            that you should consider it wrong and prove it correct yourself. To read a piece of text, or listen to a podcast, or experience
            any form of art that offers advice, truth, wisdom, or whatever is claimed to be offered, <b>assume that it is wrong</b>. But don't
            genuinely persude yourself that it is factually inept, scientifically invalid, and overall incorrect. You only get to that stage
            once you've put your own thought into it. That really goes for anything, even the words that you're reading right now. Perhaps
            assuming something is wrong initially is too pessimistic, or maybe immediately going with the judgment that the book you're reading
            is fundamentally wrong is not productive. Maybe, just maybe, the "meta-wrong" is already happening. But that might not be right either. :)
        </p>
        <p>
            To demonstrate how "assuming the worst" applies to reading <i>12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos</i>, I'll describe
            the difference between my first readthrough and my second (which I am documenting through blog posts). To start off, I can't 
            say I truly remember my first readthrough, and that's not a good sign. It doesn't mean that I didn't retain anything from 
            what I read, but it does indicate a degree of ignorance that I held. It certainly supports the idea that I read all of Jordan's
            words as the literal truth and took no opposing stance to whatever he had to say, and that's not a productive conversation at all.
            In essence, reading a book is more than just a one-sided interaction. It's not simply "writer says something to reader." That's
            not a sustainable idea, and a seriously bad one at that. If the reader has no say, or any influence in the interaction that is
            reading, then why do books even exist? It's a much more sustainable and productive process to read a book and essentially
            hold a conversation while doing so. Now that doesn't mean speak to the book like it's a person, or even formulate a response
            for every single sentence that the book has to offer. It's more than that, actually. To have a conversation with a book is to
            truly "read" it&mdash;to the point that you transcend the simplicity of the action of reading itself. The action of reading is
            a basic task that you participate in every day without even realizing it. Whether it's reading a STOP sign or even looking
            at your keyboard (not if you're a keyboard enthusiast and can touch type :)), the action of reading has become a part
            of everyday life. However, to truly read a piece of text, the reader's voice has to be involved just as much as the writer's voice
            is. Your voice should be just as important as the author's. Otherwise that's not a book you're holding, it's propaganda. 
        </p>
        <p>
            If that didn't blow your mind, I really don't know what will. Sorry to disappoint. 
        </p>
        <p>
            To continue with my description of my first readthrough (even though I barely remember it), I can say for certain
            that I went through the book incredibly fast. I am already a relatively slow reader (or so I've been told), and by
            not taking the time to truly understand what I was looking at was definitely a mistake that could have been avoided.
            I am glad that I did some writing on my first readthrough of the book, though. It started out as a Google Doc that 
            started to take on the form of very meticulous notes, nearly copying the most important phrases/sentences I found. 
            That was not a good idea. Eventually, I ended up taking a notebook and writing a page or two for each rule. So I didn't
            write everyday, but I did write my thoughts down and what I retained from the chapter that I had just finished. That
            definitely solidified my understanding of the rules, as well as how they fit into the bigger picture (that is, life). 
            I would definitely recommend jotting down your ideas after reading (particularly if it's nonfiction), and make sure
            to not have the reading in front of you while doing so. I've made the mistake of looking back to whatever I was reading
            to "optimize" how I wrote down my own thoughts, but that's a very expedient practice, and it doesn't facilitate your own 
            thinking nor your own learning. 
        </p>
        <p>
            But even with some degree of self-reflecting/writing my own thoughts down, I couldn't find myself disagreeing with
            Jordan's words. I was pressured while reflecting (whether it was writing something down or just thinking over it) to 
            get the "correct answer" and ultimately align my ideas and how they were formulated to that of Dr. Peterson's validity,
            rather than the potential for my own thoughts. Which isn't to say that what I wrote down or the time that I spent thinking
            about what I had just read was useless; it's more like that time spent could have been more wisely&mdash;in essence, a
            more meaningful manner (shoutout to Rule #7). 
        </p>
        <p>
            So what about my second time reading the book? Well, I don't have the full picture yet, as I'm still reading it. In fact,
            I'm reading slowly on purpose, as I've realized how much more time I need to write about each chapter than it takes
            for myself to read each chapter. By the time I'm done reflecting and writing about the first chapter, I will likely be in 
            the middle of the eigth or ninth chapter. Had I read at the fast pace I did the first time around, I would have already finished
            the book again weeks ago. But speed isn't what I'm aiming for; even so, the pace at which I write compared to the pace at which 
            I read will likely result in a third read of the book, or a second reread. But now that I say that, I'm likely going to have
            to reread the book many more times than I think, closer to ten times or so. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Just the pace at which I'm reading the book goes to show a significant difference, but the reason for slower reading 
            also proves another point. My slower pace isn't solely attributed to reading each sentence slower, or each word slower&mdash;it
            also stems from taking pauses to think, particularly when one sentence contradicts another, or when one esoteric word
            is used twice in one page, with an awkward gap that indicates a possible lapse in vocabulary judgment. I've found many
            instances of word choice that can face fair criticism, and I overlooked every single one on my first readthrough. It's absolutely
            amazing how looking at something the second time can bring small, but very important details into focus&mdash;which reminds
            me of the selective attention test that Jordan spoke about in his book. Of course I knew about the test before reading Dr. Peterson's
            book for the first time, but I still find it fascinating how selective we are as human beings (shoutout to whichever rule contains
            the excerpt about humans looking at each other in the eyes and looking towards where they are aiming).
        </p>
        <p>
            In essence, considering the faults of Jordan's writing has resulted in a much better experience than ignorantly
            dismissing the possibility of falsehood. As I said before, this applies to everything that you read, what you hear on the news,
            or even what comes up on your social media feed. I think that taking Dr. Peterson's word as it is, without any interpretation,
            self-reflection, and the inspiration that is deep thinking, is not something he would want his reader to do, nor any other
            reasonable creator of knowledge or wisdom for that matter. To preach an arguable opinion that borderlines on fact is a much 
            less sustainable solution than to preach objective truths and hold genuine conversations with those arguable opinions. 
            In the end, that's what we all want to see, and truly, what we need to see.
        </p>
        <p>
            On that note, the lobster might not be the crustacean that we wish for, but the invertebrate that we need.
